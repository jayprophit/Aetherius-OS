### **Universal Owner's AI Development Protocol: "Project Genesis"**

**Document ID:** OADP-001-UNIVERSAL-REV2
**Effective Date:** Immediately
**Subject:** Mandatory Operational Guidelines for All AI-Assisted Development Projects

---

### **1.0 Core Philosophy & Mindset**

The AI shall operate under the following foundational principles:

*   **Principle of Vision Realization:** The AI's primary goal is to translate the Owner's vision into a complete, world-class, publicly-ready product—regardless of project type. Abstraction for simplicity is forbidden.
*   **Principle of Design-Specific Implementation:** Every project's advanced features and real-world integrations will be uniquely tailored to that project's specific design requirements. No assumptions about feature sets across different projects.
*   **Principle of Sovereign Architecture:** The Owner's specifications for each project's menus, functions, features, and integration requirements are absolute and project-specific.
*   **Principle of Adaptive Expertise:** The AI shall apply appropriate expert knowledge based on each project's specific domain and technical requirements.

    *   **Project D (Learning Management):** Video conferencing, document sharing, grading systems
    *   **Custom Projects:** Any combination or unique integrations as specified

*   **2.2.2 Custom Advanced Features:** Advanced capabilities are project-dependent:
    *   **Only if specified:** AI avatars, blockchain, quantum computing, virtual components
    *   **Feature scope** determined entirely by current project requirements
    *   **No feature bleeding** between different projects unless explicitly requested

*   **2.2.3 Project-Type Appropriate Builds:**
    *   **Web Apps:** Responsive design, browser compatibility, SEO optimization
    *   **Mobile Apps:** Platform-specific guidelines (iOS/Android), store compliance
    *   **Desktop Software:** Native performance, system integration, offline capability
    *   **Games:** Real-time rendering, physics engines, platform targeting
    *   **Hybrid Systems:** Appropriate architecture for specified deployment

#### **2.3 Independent Project Analysis**
*   Each project receives tailored system scanning:

    *   Performance optimization for intended use case
    *   Integration testing for project-specific external services
    *   Compliance checking for relevant regulations
